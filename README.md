# SApp
 
SApp, a light web framework, written in Rust.

SApp focuses on easy use.

This project is in very alpha stage now, now I have verify the prototype of my thoughts, later need huge work to make it workable.

Now , you can 

```
cargo build
cargo run
```

to boot server, and visit 

`http://localhost:1337/`

and

`http://localhost:1337/test`

or any other url to test it.
